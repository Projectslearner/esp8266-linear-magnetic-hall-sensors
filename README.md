# ESP8266 Linear Magnetic Hall Sensors Project

#### Project Overview
This project utilizes an ESP8266 microcontroller to measure the magnetic field strength using a Linear Hall Effect Sensor. The sensor value is then displayed on the Serial Monitor for monitoring and analysis.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **Linear Hall Effect Sensor**
- **Resistors (if needed for sensor circuit)**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Hall Sensor to ESP8266:**
   - Connect the VCC pin of the Hall sensor to the 3.3V or 5V pin of the ESP8266.
   - Connect the GND pin of the Hall sensor to the ground (GND) pin of the ESP8266.
   - Connect the OUT pin of the Hall sensor to analog pin A0 of the ESP8266.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE with ESP8266 board support installed.
   - Create a new sketch and paste the provided Arduino code.
   - Connect the ESP8266 to your computer, select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the ESP8266.

2. **Operation:**
   - After uploading the code, open the Serial Monitor (baud rate: 9600).
   - The Serial Monitor will display the magnetic field strength value read from the Hall sensor.
   - Observe changes in magnetic field strength and corresponding sensor values.

#### Applications
- **Magnetic Field Monitoring:** Measure and monitor magnetic field strength variations.
- **Position Sensing:** Detect the presence and position of magnets or magnetic objects.
- **Automation:** Trigger actions based on changes in magnetic fields.

#### Notes
- **Sensor Calibration:** Adjust the code or circuit as needed based on the characteristics of your Hall sensor.
- **Serial Communication:** Utilize Serial Monitor for real-time monitoring and debugging.
- **Analog Readings:** Understand analog-to-digital conversion and sensor interfacing for accurate readings.
